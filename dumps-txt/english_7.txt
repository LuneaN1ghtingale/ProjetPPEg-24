The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (The Kingkiller Chronicle)



David Gemmell Award for Fantasy Winner:
 2012 (The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear)

The Name of the Wind and Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear are the very finest examples of first-person storytelling. It&rsquo;s comparable to sitting across from someone, in a comfy chair, before a log fire, listening to them recount one of the most intricate and fascinating stories you&rsquo;ve ever heard. To quote Ursula Le Guin: &ldquo;It is a rare and great pleasure to find a fantasist writing... with true music in the words&rdquo;.

Scott Lynch&rsquo;s trilogy features wonderful characters, plot and camaraderie, all set within a setting beautifully inspired by ancient Venice.

American Gods by Neil Gaiman


World Fantasy Award Nominee:
 2002 | 
British Fantasy Award Nominee:
 2002 | 
American Gods manages to broach several genre barriers all the while making it look as if Gaiman was creating his own genre. The end result is very much like creating a new species of rose; you take those qualities from other roses that you want, and then splice them all together. The outcome is beautiful.

The Fifth Season by NK Jemisin (The Broken Earth)


World Fantasy Award Nominee:

Reading the Broken Earth trilogy can be a brutal, painful experience. There is much tragedy, despair and the characters&rsquo; futures often look nothing but bleak.

The Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin (Earthsea Saga)


World Fantasy Award Winner:

The Earthsea books can be read by children and enjoyed simply for the magic, wizards, adventure and beautifully imagined world. They can also be read by adults and enjoyed for the thought-provoking ideas and themes that the books conjure. They are truly timeless, exploring human behaviour without being preaching or judgmental, encouraging readers to think deeply and form their own opinions.

The Realm of the Elderlings is a glorious, classic fantasy combining the magic of Le Guin&#39;s The Wizard of Earthsea with the epic mastery of Tolkien&#39;s The Lord of the Rings.

Imagine a world that is as alike as it is dissimilar to our own. Where huge zeppelins litter the skyline and a person&rsquo;s soul is a living breathing animal companion, or &#39;daemon&#39;. This is the wonderfully engrossing world of Lyra Belacqua. Although written for children it is equally as absorbing for any adult reader, enthralling from its very first page.

British Fantasy Award Winner:
 1979 (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever) | 
British Fantasy Award Nominee:
 1981 (The Wounded Land) | 
Thomas Covenant is arguably one of the most famous characters in fantasy, but not all who know it love it. Whether it is due to the Covenant character himself, or simply as a response to the series as a whole, readers find themselves divided in their opinions: Some love it, some hate it. But few dismiss it. The Chronicles are a very complex piece of work but at heart a good old-fashioned tale of epic fantasy deserving of being labelled classic.

The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone is where, for young Harry Potter, it all begins.

The Gunslinger by Stephen King (The Dark Tower series)


World Fantasy Award Winner:
 2005 (The Dark Tower) | 
Many who have read and enjoyed the Dark Tower series have found a companion for life. The journey for many has been one of years, if not decades. And many will have found within the series parallels to their own lives: It&rsquo;s not always gone the way they would have liked, many parts were better than others (though upon re-read these conceptions can change). This is King&rsquo;s magnum opus, he poured everything into its writing and it is a towering achievement.

The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson (The Stormlight Archive)


With The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson clearly stamps his authority as the master of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; style of epic fantasy. It is hard to comprehend just how much stuff is going on and how this book impacts the wider Cosmere (the universe that ties all of Sanderson&#39;s books together). Big action set pieces of extraordinary people doing extraordinary things is exactly what many want from their epic fantasy.

The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie (The First Law)


The First Law trilogy was a real game changer for the fantasy genre. It worked in shades of grey. It makes the reader like characters they should possibly, really dislike. And dislike characters they should possibly, really like. The dialogue is witty and often the cause of out-loud laughter. It&rsquo;s a captivating read and has everything a fantasy fan could wish for. Any books that can add humour to torture scenes has something special going on.

Good Omens by Terry Pratchett


World Fantasy Award Nominee:

Good Omens is one of the funniest works of fiction ever. Pratchett and Gaiman have managed to create a story that weaves together large doses of satire, cynicism, slapstick and wacky unconventional humour into a cohesive yet surprisingly accurate observation of human life all over the world. The characters, one of the biggest strengths in this book, bring a lot of charm and humour to the book. This collaboration between two fine fantasy authors is nothing short of brilliant.

British Fantasy Award Winner:
 1983 (The Sword of the Lictor) | 
The Book of the New Sun is a science fantasy classic that improves with every read. Too often overlooked, possibly due to being dense in allegory and symbolism, the joy of coming to understand Wolfe&rsquo;s craft is part of the joy of reading it. The lead character Severan, is an unreliable narrator, and this adds another layer of complexity. If you&rsquo;re a fan of both science fiction and fantasy, it is a must-read.

Emotionally shocking moments, intricate and otherworldly fight scenes, and lots of loyalty, honour and tradition. Jade City is an epic, unique and often unforgiving gangster fantasy narrative intertwined with glimpses of hope and goodness. The haunting nature of the world is also mixed with betrayals and a huge death toll. Recommended.

The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle


The Last Unicorn is one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time. Its lyrical writing, it&rsquo;s memorable and very human characters, and its exploration of mortality, immortality, and the meeting of the two never fail to move. The novel deals in a very deep and profound way with love, and loss, and the value of love; which in the case of the unicorn becomes important enough to surrender immortality to possess. There are also recurring themes of loss and grief, and the contemplation of the meaning and purpose of life (and death).

Watership Down by Richard Adams


Watership Down is a book which will always hold a special place in my heart. It has captivated and moved me for over three decades and I do not believe this will change for what I hope will be a further three. It has all the elements that I enjoy in a story: a quest, a journey, bravery, belief and the inability to accept defeat. The rabbit characters are glorious: the nervously intelligent Fiver and his kind, loyal brother Hazel. The no-nonsense Bigwig, the controlling Woundwort and the ingenious Blackberry - all rich and wonderful to spend time with.

The Magicians by Lev Grossman (The Magicians series)


The fantasy genre always needs an author to come along a show it in a different light and this is exactly what has Grossman has done with The Magicians. He has injected sexual tension and questionable morals into a school for wizards and the result is a rousing, perceptive and multifaceted coming of age story. The Magicians is perfect fantasy for older teens that will find that the author understands them, and their feelings, possibly better than they themselves do.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll


Alice in Wonderland was Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s first novel and its fantasy plot, humorous rhymes and brilliant use of nonsense was revolutionary. Nineteenth-century children&rsquo;s writing usually served moral or educational purpose, but Alice was written firmly and purely for the amusement of children. Critical response was lukewarm, but the book was still a great success, and remains a hugely influential classic of children&rsquo;s literature.

&quot;One of the most laconic, tightly-plotted tales of mythical morality you&#39;ll ever read, an anti-establishment satire disguised as a love story, more of a scary tale than a fairy tale&quot;&nbsp;Uncut

&quot;There&#39;s nothing fluffy about The Princess Bride. The rocket-powered narrative tricks you without being merely tricksy, and is both modern and timeless&quot;&nbsp;Neon

Helene Wecker writes elegantly and fluently, her characters are constantly fascinating and exploring their histories is a joy. The main setting and the narrative evoke wonderful images of nineteenth century New York and we, as the fortunate reader, get to experience Jewish and Arabic folklore fundamental to the book&rsquo;s being. Many authors have written about a golem, many have written about a djinni, but few have brought them both together in a story so seamlessly. The Golem and the Djinni is first rate historical fantasy fiction that consistently delights; a charming love story with pleasing emotional depth.

Long ago, the world of the Four Lands was torn apart by the wars of ancient Evil.

Shea must embark upon the elemental quest to find the only weapon powerful enough to keep the creatures of darkness at bay: the fabled Sword of Shannara.

&quot;And while I will agree that Brooks draws inspiration from Tolkien, he doesn&#39;t copy him. The reason I linger on this is to hopefully, impress upon you an open mind to reading this book. Do not cross this book off your &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list because you&#39;ve heard people knock it. Similarly, do not go into reading this book attempting to cross reference everything back to some other work. This is a book that deserves being critiqued on its own merit.&quot;

Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence (Broken Empire)


Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence was a book steeped in controversy - a book that seemed to have divided the Science Fiction and Fantasy community with regards to what is acceptable for people to like and enjoy. A confronting story, deliberately so, that follows a 13 year old boy named Jorg who leads a gang of marauders as they pillage their way across the countryside. Jorg is a sociopath, a willing participant, and readers get to experience the world through his damaged viewpoint. Readers get to see, through Jorg&#39;s eyes, the cold apathy with which he dispatches his enemies. It is discomforting. But Prince of Thorns is a fantastic tale of one boy&rsquo;s fight for control in a world threatening to engulf him.

If you call yourself any kind of reader of speculative fiction and can appreciate a truly rich and complex book, The Stand is a must read. Even if you&rsquo;ve never read Stephen King before, even if neither horror nor post-apocalyptic are your usual genre choice, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.&nbsp;The writing is excellent, the imagery horrifying and the atmosphere hypnotic. After the first few pages you will either find yourself hooked or repelled&hellip; it&rsquo;s that kind of book. But if you want to read one of the greatest examples of dystopian fiction with a healthy dose of fantasy thrown in then look no further.

The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman


World Fantasy Award Nominee:
 2014 | 
Ryan: An intimate trip down memory lane to a time when things were much more fantastical than what they are now. This a story that is simple on the surface, but with a depth of immersion that depends entirely on how much you connect with the story. My guess is that the further you are away from your childhood, be it through age or experience, the more you will connect with this story and the more you will fall in love with it.

All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders


All the Birds in the Sky is an intense emotional roller-coaster that flits between genres, using both sci-fi and fantasy to get its message across and although it does pit them against each other, the novel never says one is better than the other, each has its place in this story and it is by both of these working together that the best outcome will be found. All the Birds in the Sky is also a very human story focusing on the confusion and mistrust that can come from not understanding the unknown.

It by Stephen King


World Fantasy Award Nominee:
 1987 | 
It is the children who see - and feel - what makes the town so horribly different. In the storm drains and sewers &quot;It&quot; lurks, taking the shape of every nightmare, each one&#39;s deepest dread. As the children grow up and move away, the horror of &quot;It&quot; is buried deep - until they are called back.

&quot;As an exploration of childhood, growing up, friendship and facing both real and supernatural fears I still hold It up as a great book. But the ending, and the book&rsquo;s length in general, will be unpalatable to many readers.&quot;

It is a testament to&nbsp;Kuang&rsquo;s skill as a writer to establish such a strong connection with her protagonists that the impact of the events in third act hit as hard as they do.

When she turned her hand to fantasy she produced, in the words of the book&#39;s reviewer, Joshua: A magisterial&nbsp;tour de force&nbsp;of subverted narrative expectations that wrestles with what it means to find identity as a human, and as a god. Unlike anything being written, Ann Leckie will likely be remembered as a literary pioneer, and not as similar to someone else. A masterpiece of storytelling that leaves a willing reader humbled,&nbsp;The Raven Tower&nbsp;is quite simply the best book of the year &ndash; mighty, subtle, captivating, unputdownable.

The 10,000 Doors of January by Alix E Harrow


World Fantasy Award Nominee:
 2020 | 
It is a rare thing to relate to a book&rsquo;s character in such a way that similar situations evoke empathy across your lives. Enough parallels can be drawn to feel almost as if the book is catered specifically toward you in some existential way. I have not read much portal fantasy, but I have always felt a feeling of smothered repression through my youth that has tamped down my will to explore. Instead, my portals to elsewhere revealed themselves in books and stories at an early age, and they&rsquo;ve been with me ever since. Alix Harrow captures this feeling of finding oneself through the stories we share in her stunning and unforgettable debut novel The 10,000 Doors of January. It is a beautifully written and lovingly crafted adventure about the strength of love, the importance of stories, and the timeless power of words.

Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir (The Locked Tomb Trilogy)


World Fantasy Award Nominee:
 2020 (Gideon the Ninth) | 
The Emperor needs necromancers.

The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.

Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead nonsense.

Tamsyn Muir&rsquo;s Gideon the Ninth unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as arcane revenants. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.

Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won&rsquo;t set her free without a service.

Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon&rsquo;s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.

Of course, some things are better left dead.

Some authors write beautifuly and can induce an almost meditive state in the reader. Tolkien, Hobb, Le Guin, Martin can achieve this, and so can William Horwood. There are two books on the site that generate an effusive outpouring of love from readers, two books which will be well know to some but perhaps not as widely known as many books on this list, they are Swan Song by Robert McCammon and Duncton Wood. It is the moving love story of Bracken and Rebecca and the trials they must face and overcome to be as one. It is unfortunate that this work must be compared to Watership Down but that is the only book with which I can really compare it to in terms of story-line and excellence. Read my review and the reader reviews below it if you want to get a real sense of how highly this book is regarded.

Palimpsest by Catherynne M Valente


Sei, November, Ludov, and Oleg -- four people unknown to each other but united by grief and their obsession with the city of Palimpsest. Located beyond the human realm, Palimpsest is accessible only by those who sleep after generating the energy which comes from sex. Once anyone arrives in the city, they indulge in sense pleasures and are able to obtain their innermost desires -- two things which ensure that Palimpsest visitors return.

&quot;Like other Cathryn Valente books (Orphan&#39;s Tales, In the Garden of Coin and Spice), this poignant poetic work is a feast for the mind. Palimpsest is the gift of a fairy tale wrapped in an allegory and tied with a mystical ribbon. A gift that readers can enjoy again and again.&quot;

It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula. Peppered with familiar characters from Victorian history and fiction, the novel tells the story of vampire Genevi&egrave;ve Dieudonn&eacute; and Charles Beauregard of the Diogenes Club as they strive to solve the mystery of the Ripper murders. Anno Dracula is a rich and panoramic tale, combining horror, politics, mystery and romance to create a unique and compelling alternate history. Acclaimed novelist Kim Newman explores the darkest depths of a reinvented Victorian London. This brand-new edition of the bestselling novel contains unique bonus material, including a new afterword from Kim Newman, annotations, articles and alternate endings to the original novel.

&quot;Kim Newman&#39;s Anno Dracula is back in print, and we must celebrate. It was the first mash-up of literature, history and vampires, and now, in a world in which vampires are everywhere, it&#39;s still the best, and its bite is just as sharp. Compulsory reading, commentary, and mindgame: glorious.&quot;

World Fantasy Award Winner:

He calls himself Alif - few people know his real name - a young man born in a Middle Eastern city that straddles the ancient and modern worlds. When Alif meets the aristocratic Intisar, he believes he has found love. But their relationship has no future - Intisar is promised to another man and her family&#39;s honour must be satisfied. As a remembrance, Intisar sends the heartbroken Alif a mysterious book. Entitled The Thousand and One Days, Alif discovers that this parting gift is a door to another world - a world from a very different time, when old magic was in the ascendant and the djinn walked amongst us. With the book in his hands, Alif finds himself drawing attention - far too much attention - from both men and djinn. Thus begins an adventure that takes him through the crumbling streets of a once-beautiful city, to uncover the long-forgotten mysteries of the Unseen. Alif is about to become a fugitive in both the corporeal and incorporeal worlds. And he is about to unleash a destructive power that will change everything and everyone - starting with Alif himself.

&quot;I would highly recommend this book to anybody who like a ripping yarn, whether they are into fantasy or not because this is more of a thriller with echoes of the computer acrobatics seen in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, which I find really interesting, but set against an exotic landscape that really comes to life. You can feel and smell the duststorm as it sweeps over the houses, seeping its way in through the cracks, the panic as The Hand, an unbending, alien force, closes in, and the awkwardness of a young American scholar who tries to help Alif but is so clearly out of place. Overall, a sumptuous, colourful and many-layered novel.&quot;
