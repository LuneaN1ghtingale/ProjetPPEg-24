1. Introduction

In this brief work, I would like to outline my opinion that perceptions of the genre of fantasy, particularly for narrative and the use of imagination in children's literature, are mistakenly over-treated by a pseudo-realist view. As Bruno Bettleheim said, "fairy tales are important not because they tell us that dragons can be defeated, but because they tell us that the dragons exist." I would like to show that the use of the unreal offers emergent readers important coping mechanisms to oppressive ongoing phasing by relating extremely closely with important cognizing models for solving narrative problems that are presented to characters. I would also like to point out that this genre is not used nearly enough by authors and is also subject to inappropriate editing by publishers. Additionally, it is an area sparsely populated and dominated mainly by insidious and effective prose. When parents speak to me about fantasy, I think that they are actually referring to nightmares and horror, both elements that they perceive as unavoidable constituents of their children's narratives. With small emanate control mechanisms, I would simply suggest that only evil dominates their general lives and that perhaps considerations should be given to their volume. I will not touch on the psychological aspect, as Bettleheim has been extensively written about, nor the literary developments, nor reference Utopian suggestions over moderation of the literary diet evident at public libraries. What I would like to refer to, however, are the repeated requests often seen on public websites, by academics, and by parents alike to deplore the meager number of texts and materials appearing in the genre of fantasy today.

1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination

Our view of reality and understanding of the world are shaped by fantasy and imagination. These two terms are often used interchangeably as a result of their pivotal role in the process of creating narratives. However, while imagination is generally identified as a cognitive process that creates the images of these narratives, fantasy is considered as the content or reason for these narratives in literary studies. The reason why these two terms are confused is the different meanings attached to them by psychologists and literary experts. Among literary critics, fantasy is often defined as a power that impels the creation of a work or works of art, or which seeks beauty outside of reality. 1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination It is rare for a work to be created completely from or based only on facts from real life. Personal experiences, feelings and thoughts are processed and transformed into a product that most people would be able to relate to and occasionally, if it is a creative product, fantasy and imagination may be at the core of such imaginative acts. Both concepts herald new ideas and alternative constructions. However, although they give rise to the same works, fantasy and imagination can have different forms, functions and aims during their construction. As a result, the two terms are often misused. Yet writers and psychologists have sought to distinguish between them by creating different definitions to explain these differences.

2. Historical Perspectives

This leads to a further point. It is widely held - not least by psychoanalysts - that fantasy and imagination are of special importance in relation to the development and health of the human personality. One might, on the basis of this supposition, conclude that the credibility and importance of the narrative in other matters of information should increase year by year. The large number of radio talk programs in which the well-taught listener is regaled with stories of the miraculous or unusual exploits of others might well be cited in this connection, although it is probable that excessive evidence of the importance of fantasy and imagination even in the matter of securing true information contributes to a depreciation of the narratives presented. Our first sources of stories, after oral tradition, are to be found in the works of the earliest great writers. Here we find, also, miracle stories, tales of the lives of saints, fables, tales. And if we consider the mythologies of the races of the world we find them, too, composed of fantasy and imagination and, of course, symbolism. Psychologists and students of mythology and the history of religion have more recently given these artifacts of human creativity their respect. Only those who find the real dependent upon the material, who, therefore, require photographs of asteroids and the vacuum of interstellar space as evidence of the important and the miraculous, reject these products of the human mind as guides to knowledge or insights.

2.1. Fantasy in Ancient Literature

Fantasy literature deals with characters, settings, and events that are not bound by realism. However, it is worth noticing that fantasy has been an essential part of human life. The roots of fantasy can be traced back to the ancient traditions of oral storytelling. Odysseus caught in the Cyclops' cave, or Theseus killing the Minotaur in the palace of Knossos are just a few examples which are usually present in some of the earliest stories of ancient literature. This kind of stories includes some extraordinary events that are not bound by any natural norm. In the case of the ancient world, almost in all Greek or Latin poetic works, whether it is Hesiod, Homer, Aeschylus, Thucydides, Sophocles, or Euripides, supernatural phenomena are found. Additionally, it was significant to compare fantasy that goes further and introduces imaginary worlds. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to briefly demonstrate the significance of fantasy and the use of the imagination in both ancient and modern literature. Detailing the key ideas about the fantasy in ancient literature are of importance because it can be viewed as a prelude or a pattern to almost all literary works that deal with the genre of fantasy. And while finding the similar and different aspects of ancient fantasy may help us understand the viewpoint of the ancient world, that is, it was not only the process of denaturalization of nature but also the pleasure of feeling and experiencing a fantasy element and the existence of an imaginary sphere in a different world with its own rules. The existence of ancient fantasy in such an intense and loaded manner may not seriously surprise us today, and this could be a psychological reflex of the modern person for claiming the fantasy and the imagination or to create self-designed worlds with unrealistic characteristics.

3. Psychological and Cognitive Aspects

The cognitive activity of building (formulating) the plot in a literary text is of great compositional importance. It has the following mechanisms: a) the virtual re-envisioning of space, actions, and phenomena in full detail in a subjective imaginary fashion, with the filling out of partial, vague, speech-generic, and semantic-image mental signs; b) the "generation" of such details, that is, the occurrence of new components of scenarios and narrative spaces (for example, the specific landscape or the épater-les-bourgeois entourage, roles, and interventions of characters); and c) the ability to "think up" the utopian or fantastic, to think, or to make it possible to think, in unreal, non-actual conditions and by virtue of this to predict, verify, experiment, to analyze superimpose irreal alternatives to real development of phenomena both that are significant and accessible to possible human perception and that are culturally and historically universal. Cognitive activity pre-determines the ability of narrative to solve a group of psychological functions. What are the psychological and the communicative significance of this? To put it briefly, the "what" of a text is its meaning, i.e., the effect it produces on the consciousness of its recipient, the share of significance which the literary truth influences the entire communicational socially-normative system of this consciousness in accordance with the comprehension of certain literary constituents.

3.1. Role of Imagination in Creativity

An essential function of imagination is creativity. This important function of thinking is apparent in various situations of problem-solving, in making discoveries, elaborating on the political, religious, philosophical, and scientific fields, in literature, art, music, and science, as well as in the great erosive advances in human society. Without the funding of imagination, it is impossible to make a basic step in the great majority of new disciplines and trades, as at first they are only fabrications of the human mind. It is exactly through imagination that the predictions and events take place before people test them, showing if they are right, partly right, or wrong. To the philosophers, artists, scientists, and other men of thought, we may define imagination as a powerful engine of discovery, as it is fundamental for the development of the event of creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, encouraging people to believe that what is unknown can be known. In the exercise of this creative activity, the symbol of novelty that is attributed to the originality of the own imaginatively here shown motivates others to follow its example and bring new contributions. The creative is not contemporary or present, not relying on habituating and repetitive behavior, does not fear to explore ideas without vigilance or predisposition, and always delights in beauty, originality, and nobility, always looking forward to a reward. It is always willing to work on his innovation whether it has an impact, believing in the anonymity of the task, that it does not make mistakes that we can serve as models and to move the intelligence and sensibility of others, expressing themselves in the value that the truth holds. Small creative ideas writing are not only leading the biggest ideas and the children of the masterpieces, leveling modern lives and achieving extraordinary results. Thus, we have two fundamental categories of mental activity, which is the same process that we design and use, and is that if we do not build what we do not have to design.

4. Fantasy and Imagination in Contemporary Literature

It is in the 20th century that the word imagination finds its present meaning, i.e. the poet's capacity to create artificial forms either of beauty or ugliness as similar as possible to the human world in all its forms. If we bear in mind the fact that present-day fiction is neither a transcription of the actual world nor a reflection of the historical world, and also because its characters and human behaviour are to be understood in terms of signs, we realize the importance of the role played not only by imagination but by the writer's manipulative skills. "The imaginative invention of another starreate of an alternative world has been somewhat technicalized and to some extent psychologicalized." According to Edward Mendelson, the only radical and coherent difference between fantasy and the realist novel is that what is described in the latter are man, in his existent and possible condition. The realist novel negates nothing, leaving everything in its place, showing its effects. The typical hero of a fantastic story may be human, but it is specifically because of a break with the normal world.

4.1. Magical Realism

In "Magical Realism in José Donoso's Short Novels," Alyaida Márquez explains that Donoso uses "elemental force" in his fiction. For example, in a short story, there are "gruesome bent trees that are said to have devoured the married couple found beneath their twisted bodies." Moreover, she refers to "magical events in what is otherwise a realistic setting." In the Chilean author's novel "House of Spirits," the essential element of magical realism is the character, also the narrator, Lady Paralta. Magical realism generally revolves around characters in the novel who possess hidden powers or are all-knowing beings. In other words, characters that are magical. Only certain select on the social scale tend to have these powers. Márquez states, in "Voyage," "only eccentrics, those who have turned away from the predictable, spend money on such liberties." These others also "represent the alternative force that resists mystical manipulation." For example, the all-knowing character of Lady Paralta blackmails Nivea's husband into helping her expose the political leader Jaime. Since she has been entwined with the prominent people, this character develops a hidden ability to perceive things and tell the future. In the novel, Lady Paralta criticizes Esteban Trueba for taking Nivea for granted. This stimulates her cousin to plead Esteban to bring back Nivea by sending her a letter written in "carved wooden puzzle letters." At the time of publication, Donoso also exclaimed, "readers in the sixties rather preferred the magical to the real." As a result, Donoso may have incorporated magic into his texts to garner the Latin American audience. By creating magical characters with special knowledge of the future, Donoso thus creates plots that stimulate the imagination and fantasy of the readers.

5. Conclusion and Future Directions

The use of fantasy and imagination in narrative The present paper provides a review of the literary criticism and empirical literature that focuses on the role of fantasy and imagination in narrative. Research studies that examine the narrative world of journalists, critics, and commentators from various disciplines and that focus on matters of concern to literature pedagogy and arts-based research are analyzed in order to present readers with an overview of this narrative element. Future research studies are suggested in order to raise awareness of the irony and reversals in narrative to get mental health professionals to pay more attention to the complexity of their view. Fantasy and imagination are essential elements of our everyday life as well as our professional life, and they also play an important role when any narrative is used to explain matters or subjects. Nevertheless, mental health professionals often disregard these narrative elements and thus lose the opportunity to adequately implement them in the prevention and treatment of psychological problems. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of research that has been conducted into the professional use of literary criticism and to provide future research directions that might be used in order to develop mental health professionals’ awareness of these narrative elements.

self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003ch2 id=\"1-introduction\"\u003e1. Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this brief work, I would like to outline my opinion that perceptions of the genre of fantasy, particularly for narrative and the use of imagination in children's literature, are mistakenly over-treated by a pseudo-realist view. As Bruno Bettleheim said, \"fairy tales are important not because they tell us that dragons can be defeated, but because they tell us that the dragons exist.\" I would like to show that the use of the unreal offers emergent readers important coping mechanisms to oppressive ongoing phasing by relating extremely closely with important cognizing models for solving narrative problems that are presented to characters. I would also like to point out that this genre is not used nearly enough by authors and is also subject to inappropriate editing by publishers. Additionally, it is an area sparsely populated and dominated mainly by insidious and effective prose. When parents speak to me about fantasy, I think that they are actually referring to nightmares and horror, both elements that they perceive as unavoidable constituents of their children's narratives. With small emanate control mechanisms, I would simply suggest that only evil dominates their general lives and that perhaps considerations should be given to their volume. I will not touch on the psychological aspect, as Bettleheim has been extensively written about, nor the literary developments, nor reference Utopian suggestions over moderation of the literary diet evident at public libraries. What I would like to refer to, however, are the repeated requests often seen on public websites, by academics, and by parents alike to deplore the meager number of texts and materials appearing in the genre of fantasy today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"11-definition-of-fantasy-and-imagination\"\u003e1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur view of reality and understanding of the world are shaped by fantasy and imagination. These two terms are often used interchangeably as a result of their pivotal role in the process of creating narratives. However, while imagination is generally identified as a cognitive process that creates the images of these narratives, fantasy is considered as the content or reason for these narratives in literary studies. The reason why these two terms are confused is the different meanings attached to them by psychologists and literary experts. Among literary critics, fantasy is often defined as a power that impels the creation of a work or works of art, or which seeks beauty outside of reality. 1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination It is rare for a work to be created completely from or based only on facts from real life. Personal experiences, feelings and thoughts are processed and transformed into a product that most people would be able to relate to and occasionally, if it is a creative product, fantasy and imagination may be at the core of such imaginative acts. Both concepts herald new ideas and alternative constructions. However, although they give rise to the same works, fantasy and imagination can have different forms, functions and aims during their construction. As a result, the two terms are often misused. Yet writers and psychologists have sought to distinguish between them by creating different definitions to explain these differences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"2-historical-perspectives\"\u003e2. Historical Perspectives\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis leads to a further point. It is widely held - not least by psychoanalysts - that fantasy and imagination are of special importance in relation to the development and health of the human personality. One might, on the basis of this supposition, conclude that the credibility and importance of the narrative in other matters of information should increase year by year. The large number of radio talk programs in which the well-taught listener is regaled with stories of the miraculous or unusual exploits of others might well be cited in this connection, although it is probable that excessive evidence of the importance of fantasy and imagination even in the matter of securing true information contributes to a depreciation of the narratives presented. Our first sources of stories, after oral tradition, are to be found in the works of the earliest great writers. Here we find, also, miracle stories, tales of the lives of saints, fables, tales. And if we consider the mythologies of the races of the world we find them, too, composed of fantasy and imagination and, of course, symbolism. Psychologists and students of mythology and the history of religion have more recently given these artifacts of human creativity their respect. Only those who find the real dependent upon the material, who, therefore, require photographs of asteroids and the vacuum of interstellar space as evidence of the important and the miraculous, reject these products of the human mind as guides to knowledge or insights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"21-fantasy-in-ancient-literature\"\u003e2.1. Fantasy in Ancient Literature\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFantasy literature deals with characters, settings, and events that are not bound by realism. However, it is worth noticing that fantasy has been an essential part of human life. The roots of fantasy can be traced back to the ancient traditions of oral storytelling. Odysseus caught in the Cyclops' cave, or Theseus killing the Minotaur in the palace of Knossos are just a few examples which are usually present in some of the earliest stories of ancient literature. This kind of stories includes some extraordinary events that are not bound by any natural norm. In the case of the ancient world, almost in all Greek or Latin poetic works, whether it is Hesiod, Homer, Aeschylus, Thucydides, Sophocles, or Euripides, supernatural phenomena are found. Additionally, it was significant to compare fantasy that goes further and introduces imaginary worlds. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to briefly demonstrate the significance of fantasy and the use of the imagination in both ancient and modern literature. Detailing the key ideas about the fantasy in ancient literature are of importance because it can be viewed as a prelude or a pattern to almost all literary works that deal with the genre of fantasy. And while finding the similar and different aspects of ancient fantasy may help us understand the viewpoint of the ancient world, that is, it was not only the process of denaturalization of nature but also the pleasure of feeling and experiencing a fantasy element and the existence of an imaginary sphere in a different world with its own rules. The existence of ancient fantasy in such an intense and loaded manner may not seriously surprise us today, and this could be a psychological reflex of the modern person for claiming the fantasy and the imagination or to create self-designed worlds with unrealistic characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"3-psychological-and-cognitive-aspects\"\u003e3. Psychological and Cognitive Aspects\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cognitive activity of building (formulating) the plot in a literary text is of great compositional importance. It has the following mechanisms: a) the virtual re-envisioning of space, actions, and phenomena in full detail in a subjective imaginary fashion, with the filling out of partial, vague, speech-generic, and semantic-image mental signs; b) the \"generation\" of such details, that is, the occurrence of new components of scenarios and narrative spaces (for example, the specific landscape or the épater-les-bourgeois entourage, roles, and interventions of characters); and c) the ability to \"think up\" the utopian or fantastic, to think, or to make it possible to think, in unreal, non-actual conditions and by virtue of this to predict, verify, experiment, to analyze superimpose irreal alternatives to real development of phenomena both that are significant and accessible to possible human perception and that are culturally and historically universal. Cognitive activity pre-determines the ability of narrative to solve a group of psychological functions. What are the psychological and the communicative significance of this? To put it briefly, the \"what\" of a text is its meaning, i.e., the effect it produces on the consciousness of its recipient, the share of significance which the literary truth influences the entire communicational socially-normative system of this consciousness in accordance with the comprehension of certain literary constituents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"31-role-of-imagination-in-creativity\"\u003e3.1. Role of Imagination in Creativity\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn essential function of imagination is creativity. This important function of thinking is apparent in various situations of problem-solving, in making discoveries, elaborating on the political, religious, philosophical, and scientific fields, in literature, art, music, and science, as well as in the great erosive advances in human society. Without the funding of imagination, it is impossible to make a basic step in the great majority of new disciplines and trades, as at first they are only fabrications of the human mind. It is exactly through imagination that the predictions and events take place before people test them, showing if they are right, partly right, or wrong. To the philosophers, artists, scientists, and other men of thought, we may define imagination as a powerful engine of discovery, as it is fundamental for the development of the event of creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, encouraging people to believe that what is unknown can be known. In the exercise of this creative activity, the symbol of novelty that is attributed to the originality of the own imaginatively here shown motivates others to follow its example and bring new contributions. The creative is not contemporary or present, not relying on habituating and repetitive behavior, does not fear to explore ideas without vigilance or predisposition, and always delights in beauty, originality, and nobility, always looking forward to a reward. It is always willing to work on his innovation whether it has an impact, believing in the anonymity of the task, that it does not make mistakes that we can serve as models and to move the intelligence and sensibility of others, expressing themselves in the value that the truth holds. Small creative ideas writing are not only leading the biggest ideas and the children of the masterpieces, leveling modern lives and achieving extraordinary results. Thus, we have two fundamental categories of mental activity, which is the same process that we design and use, and is that if we do not build what we do not have to design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"4-fantasy-and-imagination-in-contemporary-literature\"\u003e4. Fantasy and Imagination in Contemporary Literature\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is in the 20th century that the word imagination finds its present meaning, i.e. the poet's capacity to create artificial forms either of beauty or ugliness as similar as possible to the human world in all its forms. If we bear in mind the fact that present-day fiction is neither a transcription of the actual world nor a reflection of the historical world, and also because its characters and human behaviour are to be understood in terms of signs, we realize the importance of the role played not only by imagination but by the writer's manipulative skills. \"The imaginative invention of another starreate of an alternative world has been somewhat technicalized and to some extent psychologicalized.\" According to Edward Mendelson, the only radical and coherent difference between fantasy and the realist novel is that what is described in the latter are man, in his existent and possible condition. The realist novel negates nothing, leaving everything in its place, showing its effects. The typical hero of a fantastic story may be human, but it is specifically because of a break with the normal world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"41-magical-realism\"\u003e4.1. Magical Realism\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \"Magical Realism in José Donoso's Short Novels,\" Alyaida Márquez explains that Donoso uses \"elemental force\" in his fiction. For example, in a short story, there are \"gruesome bent trees that are said to have devoured the married couple found beneath their twisted bodies.\" Moreover, she refers to \"magical events in what is otherwise a realistic setting.\" In the Chilean author's novel \"House of Spirits,\" the essential element of magical realism is the character, also the narrator, Lady Paralta. Magical realism generally revolves around characters in the novel who possess hidden powers or are all-knowing beings. In other words, characters that are magical. Only certain select on the social scale tend to have these powers. Márquez states, in \"Voyage,\" \"only eccentrics, those who have turned away from the predictable, spend money on such liberties.\" These others also \"represent the alternative force that resists mystical manipulation.\" For example, the all-knowing character of Lady Paralta blackmails Nivea's husband into helping her expose the political leader Jaime. Since she has been entwined with the prominent people, this character develops a hidden ability to perceive things and tell the future. In the novel, Lady Paralta criticizes Esteban Trueba for taking Nivea for granted. This stimulates her cousin to plead Esteban to bring back Nivea by sending her a letter written in \"carved wooden puzzle letters.\" At the time of publication, Donoso also exclaimed, \"readers in the sixties rather preferred the magical to the real.\" As a result, Donoso may have incorporated magic into his texts to garner the Latin American audience. By creating magical characters with special knowledge of the future, Donoso thus creates plots that stimulate the imagination and fantasy of the readers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5-conclusion-and-future-directions\"\u003e5. Conclusion and Future Directions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe use of fantasy and imagination in narrative The present paper provides a review of the literary criticism and empirical literature that focuses on the role of fantasy and imagination in narrative. Research studies that examine the narrative world of journalists, critics, and commentators from various disciplines and that focus on matters of concern to literature pedagogy and arts-based research are analyzed in order to present readers with an overview of this narrative element. Future research studies are suggested in order to raise awareness of the irony and reversals in narrative to get mental health professionals to pay more attention to the complexity of their view. Fantasy and imagination are essential elements of our everyday life as well as our professional life, and they also play an important role when any narrative is used to explain matters or subjects. Nevertheless, mental health professionals often disregard these narrative elements and thus lose the opportunity to adequately implement them in the prevention and treatment of psychological problems. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of research that has been conducted into the professional use of literary criticism and to provide future research directions that might be used in order to develop mental health professionals’ awareness of these narrative elements.\u003c/p\u003e"])

Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this brief work, I would like to outline my opinion that perceptions of the genre of fantasy, particularly for narrative and the use of imagination in children's literature, are mistakenly over-treated by a pseudo-realist view. As Bruno Bettleheim said, \"fairy tales are important not because they tell us that dragons can be defeated, but because they tell us that the dragons exist.\" I would like to show that the use of the unreal offers emergent readers important coping mechanisms to oppressive ongoing phasing by relating extremely closely with important cognizing models for solving narrative problems that are presented to characters. I would also like to point out that this genre is not used nearly enough by authors and is also subject to inappropriate editing by publishers. Additionally, it is an area sparsely populated and dominated mainly by insidious and effective prose. When parents speak to me about fantasy, I think that they are actually referring to nightmares and horror, both elements that they perceive as unavoidable constituents of their children's narratives. With small emanate control mechanisms, I would simply suggest that only evil dominates their general lives and that perhaps considerations should be given to their volume. I will not touch on the psychological aspect, as Bettleheim has been extensively written about, nor the literary developments, nor reference Utopian suggestions over moderation of the literary diet evident at public libraries. What I would like to refer to, however, are the repeated requests often seen on public websites, by academics, and by parents alike to deplore the meager number of texts and materials appearing in the genre of fantasy today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"11-definition-of-fantasy-and-imagination\"\u003e1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur view of reality and understanding of the world are shaped by fantasy and imagination. These two terms are often used interchangeably as a result of their pivotal role in the process of creating narratives. However, while imagination is generally identified as a cognitive process that creates the images of these narratives, fantasy is considered as the content or reason for these narratives in literary studies. The reason why these two terms are confused is the different meanings attached to them by psychologists and literary experts. Among literary critics, fantasy is often defined as a power that impels the creation of a work or works of art, or which seeks beauty outside of reality. 1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination It is rare for a work to be created completely from or based only on facts from real life. Personal experiences, feelings and thoughts are processed and transformed into a product that most people would be able to relate to and occasionally, if it is a creative product, fantasy and imagination may be at the core of such imaginative acts. Both concepts herald new ideas and alternative constructions. However, although they give rise to the same works, fantasy and imagination can have different forms, functions and aims during their construction. As a result, the two terms are often misused. Yet writers and psychologists have sought to distinguish between them by creating different definitions to explain these differences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"2-historical-perspectives\"\u003e2. Historical Perspectives\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis leads to a further point.

Without the funding of imagination, it is impossible to make a basic step in the great majority of new disciplines and trades, as at first they are only fabrications of the human mind. It is exactly through imagination that the predictions and events take place before people test them, showing if they are right, partly right, or wrong. To the philosophers, artists, scientists, and other men of thought, we may define imagination as a powerful engine of discovery, as it is fundamental for the development of the event of creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, encouraging people to believe that what is unknown can be known. In the exercise of this creative activity, the symbol of novelty that is attributed to the originality of the own imaginatively here shown motivates others to follow its example and bring new contributions. The creative is not contemporary or present, not relying on habituating and repetitive behavior, does not fear to explore ideas without vigilance or predisposition, and always delights in beauty, originality, and nobility, always looking forward to a reward. It is always willing to work on his innovation whether it has an impact, believing in the anonymity of the task, that it does not make mistakes that we can serve as models and to move the intelligence and sensibility of others, expressing themselves in the value that the truth holds. Small creative ideas writing are not only leading the biggest ideas and the children of the masterpieces, leveling modern lives and achieving extraordinary results. Thus, we have two fundamental categories of mental activity, which is the same process that we design and use, and is that if we do not build what we do not have to design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"4-fantasy-and-imagination-in-contemporary-literature\"\u003e4. Fantasy and Imagination in Contemporary Literature\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is in the 20th century that the word imagination finds its present meaning, i.e. the poet's capacity to create artificial forms either of beauty or ugliness as similar as possible to the human world in all its forms. If we bear in mind the fact that present-day fiction is neither a transcription of the actual world nor a reflection of the historical world, and also because its characters and human behaviour are to be understood in terms of signs, we realize the importance of the role played not only by imagination but by the writer's manipulative skills. \"The imaginative invention of another starreate of an alternative world has been somewhat technicalized and to some extent psychologicalized.\" According to Edward Mendelson, the only radical and coherent difference between fantasy and the realist novel is that what is described in the latter are man, in his existent and possible condition. The realist novel negates nothing, leaving everything in its place, showing its effects. The typical hero of a fantastic story may be human, but it is specifically because of a break with the normal world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"41-magical-realism\"\u003e4.1. Magical Realism\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \"Magical Realism in José Donoso's Short Novels,\" Alyaida Márquez explains that Donoso uses \"elemental force\" in his fiction. For example, in a short story, there are \"gruesome bent trees that are said to have devoured the married couple found beneath their twisted bodies.\" Moreover, she refers to \"magical events in what is otherwise a realistic setting.\" In the Chilean author's novel \"House of Spirits,\" the essential element of magical realism is the character, also the narrator, Lady Paralta. Magical realism generally revolves around characters in the novel who possess hidden powers or are all-knowing beings. In other words, characters that are magical. Only certain select on the social scale tend to have these powers. Márquez states, in \"Voyage,\" \"only eccentrics, those who have turned away from the predictable, spend money on such liberties.\" These others also \"represent the alternative force that resists mystical manipulation.\" For example, the all-knowing character of Lady Paralta blackmails Nivea's husband into helping her expose the political leader Jaime. Since she has been entwined with the prominent people, this character develops a hidden ability to perceive things and tell the future. In the novel, Lady Paralta criticizes Esteban Trueba for taking Nivea for granted. This stimulates her cousin to plead Esteban to bring back Nivea by sending her a letter written in \"carved wooden puzzle letters.\" At the time of publication, Donoso also exclaimed, \"readers in the sixties rather preferred the magical to the real.\" As a result, Donoso may have incorporated magic into his texts to garner the Latin American audience. By creating magical characters with special knowledge of the future, Donoso thus creates plots that stimulate the imagination and fantasy of the readers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5-conclusion-and-future-directions\"\u003e5. Conclusion and Future Directions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe use of fantasy and imagination in narrative The present paper provides a review of the literary criticism and empirical literature that focuses on the role of fantasy and imagination in narrative. Research studies that examine the narrative world of journalists, critics, and commentators from various disciplines and that focus on matters of concern to literature pedagogy and arts-based research are analyzed in order to present readers with an overview of this narrative element. Future research studies are suggested in order to raise awareness of the irony and reversals in narrative to get mental health professionals to pay more attention to the complexity of their view. Fantasy and imagination are essential elements of our everyday life as well as our professional life, and they also play an important role when any narrative is used to explain matters or subjects. Nevertheless, mental health professionals often disregard these narrative elements and thus lose the opportunity to adequately implement them in the prevention and treatment of psychological problems. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of research that has been conducted into the professional use of literary criticism and to provide future research directions that might be used in order to develop mental health professionals’ awareness of these narrative elements.\u003c/p\u003e"])

Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this brief work, I would like to outline my opinion that perceptions of the genre of fantasy, particularly for narrative and the use of imagination in children's literature, are mistakenly over-treated by a pseudo-realist view. As Bruno Bettleheim said, \"fairy tales are important not because they tell us that dragons can be defeated, but because they tell us that the dragons exist.\" I would like to show that the use of the unreal offers emergent readers important coping mechanisms to oppressive ongoing phasing by relating extremely closely with important cognizing models for solving narrative problems that are presented to characters. I would also like to point out that this genre is not used nearly enough by authors and is also subject to inappropriate editing by publishers. Additionally, it is an area sparsely populated and dominated mainly by insidious and effective prose. When parents speak to me about fantasy, I think that they are actually referring to nightmares and horror, both elements that they perceive as unavoidable constituents of their children's narratives. With small emanate control mechanisms, I would simply suggest that only evil dominates their general lives and that perhaps considerations should be given to their volume. I will not touch on the psychological aspect, as Bettleheim has been extensively written about, nor the literary developments, nor reference Utopian suggestions over moderation of the literary diet evident at public libraries. What I would like to refer to, however, are the repeated requests often seen on public websites, by academics, and by parents alike to deplore the meager number of texts and materials appearing in the genre of fantasy today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"11-definition-of-fantasy-and-imagination\"\u003e1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur view of reality and understanding of the world are shaped by fantasy and imagination. These two terms are often used interchangeably as a result of their pivotal role in the process of creating narratives. However, while imagination is generally identified as a cognitive process that creates the images of these narratives, fantasy is considered as the content or reason for these narratives in literary studies. The reason why these two terms are confused is the different meanings attached to them by psychologists and literary experts. Among literary critics, fantasy is often defined as a power that impels the creation of a work or works of art, or which seeks beauty outside of reality. 1.1. Definition of Fantasy and Imagination It is rare for a work to be created completely from or based only on facts from real life. Personal experiences, feelings and thoughts are processed and transformed into a product that most people would be able to relate to and occasionally, if it is a creative product, fantasy and imagination may be at the core of such imaginative acts. Both concepts herald new ideas and alternative constructions. However, although they give rise to the same works, fantasy and imagination can have different forms, functions and aims during their construction. As a result, the two terms are often misused. Yet writers and psychologists have sought to distinguish between them by creating different definitions to explain these differences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"2-historical-perspectives\"\u003e2. Historical Perspectives\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis leads to a further point. It is widely held - not least by psychoanalysts - that fantasy and imagination are of special importance in relation to the development and health of the human personality. One might, on the basis of this supposition, conclude that the credibility and importance of the narrative in other matters of information should increase year by year. The large number of radio talk programs in which the well-taught listener is regaled with stories of the miraculous or unusual exploits of others might well be cited in this connection, although it is probable that excessive evidence of the importance of fantasy and imagination even in the matter of securing true information contributes to a depreciation of the narratives presented. Our first sources of stories, after oral tradition, are to be found in the works of the earliest great writers. Here we find, also, miracle stories, tales of the lives of saints, fables, tales. And if we consider the mythologies of the races of the world we find them, too, composed of fantasy and imagination and, of course, symbolism. Psychologists and students of mythology and the history of religion have more recently given these artifacts of human creativity their respect. Only those who find the real dependent upon the material, who, therefore, require photographs of asteroids and the vacuum of interstellar space as evidence of the important and the miraculous, reject these products of the human mind as guides to knowledge or insights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"21-fantasy-in-ancient-literature\"\u003e2.1. Fantasy in Ancient Literature\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFantasy literature deals with characters, settings, and events that are not bound by realism. However, it is worth noticing that fantasy has been an essential part of human life. The roots of fantasy can be traced back to the ancient traditions of oral storytelling. Odysseus caught in the Cyclops' cave, or Theseus killing the Minotaur in the palace of Knossos are just a few examples which are usually present in some of the earliest stories of ancient literature. This kind of stories includes some extraordinary events that are not bound by any natural norm. In the case of the ancient world, almost in all Greek or Latin poetic works, whether it is Hesiod, Homer, Aeschylus, Thucydides, Sophocles, or Euripides, supernatural phenomena are found. Additionally, it was significant to compare fantasy that goes further and introduces imaginary worlds. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to briefly demonstrate the significance of fantasy and the use of the imagination in both ancient and modern literature. Detailing the key ideas about the fantasy in ancient literature are of importance because it can be viewed as a prelude or a pattern to almost all literary works that deal with the genre of fantasy. And while finding the similar and different aspects of ancient fantasy may help us understand the viewpoint of the ancient world, that is, it was not only the process of denaturalization of nature but also the pleasure of feeling and experiencing a fantasy element and the existence of an imaginary sphere in a different world with its own rules. The existence of ancient fantasy in such an intense and loaded manner may not seriously surprise us today, and this could be a psychological reflex of the modern person for claiming the fantasy and the imagination or to create self-designed worlds with unrealistic characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"3-psychological-and-cognitive-aspects\"\u003e3. Psychological and Cognitive Aspects\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cognitive activity of building (formulating) the plot in a literary text is of great compositional importance. It has the following mechanisms: a) the virtual re-envisioning of space, actions, and phenomena in full detail in a subjective imaginary fashion, with the filling out of partial, vague, speech-generic, and semantic-image mental signs; b) the \"generation\" of such details, that is, the occurrence of new components of scenarios and narrative spaces (for example, the specific landscape or the épater-les-bourgeois entourage, roles, and interventions of characters); and c) the ability to \"think up\" the utopian or fantastic, to think, or to make it possible to think, in unreal, non-actual conditions and by virtue of this to predict, verify, experiment, to analyze superimpose irreal alternatives to real development of phenomena both that are significant and accessible to possible human perception and that are culturally and historically universal. Cognitive activity pre-determines the ability of narrative to solve a group of psychological functions. What are the psychological and the communicative significance of this? To put it briefly, the \"what\" of a text is its meaning, i.e., the effect it produces on the consciousness of its recipient, the share of significance which the literary truth influences the entire communicational socially-normative system of this consciousness in accordance with the comprehension of certain literary constituents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"31-role-of-imagination-in-creativity\"\u003e3.1.

By creating magical characters with special knowledge of the future, Donoso thus creates plots that stimulate the imagination and fantasy of the readers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5-conclusion-and-future-directions\"\u003e5. Conclusion and Future Directions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe use of fantasy and imagination in narrative The present paper provides a review of the literary criticism and empirical literature that focuses on the role of fantasy and imagination in narrative. Research studies that examine the narrative world of journalists, critics, and commentators from various disciplines and that focus on matters of concern to literature pedagogy and arts-based research are analyzed in order to present readers with an overview of this narrative element. Future research studies are suggested in order to raise awareness of the irony and reversals in narrative to get mental health professionals to pay more attention to the complexity of their view. Fantasy and imagination are essential elements of our everyday life as well as our professional life, and they also play an important role when any narrative is used to explain matters or subjects. Nevertheless, mental health professionals often disregard these narrative elements and thus lose the opportunity to adequately implement them in the prevention and treatment of psychological problems. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of research that has been conducted into the professional use of literary criticism and to provide future research directions that might be used in order to develop mental health professionals’ awareness of these narrative elements.\u003c/p\u003e"])
